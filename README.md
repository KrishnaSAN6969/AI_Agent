🧠 AI Research Assistant

This project is a research assistant powered by large language models and LangChain’s agent framework. It is designed to take natural language queries, use external tools, and return structured research results.

🌍 Concept

The assistant works like a mini research pipeline:

Input Query – The user provides a research question in plain English.

Agent Reasoning – The system decides which tools are needed to answer the query.

Tool Execution – It calls tools such as:

A search tool for web queries.

A wiki tool for retrieving structured knowledge.

A save tool for persisting results.

Structured Response – The output is formatted into a predefined schema (topic, summary, sources, tools used).

📖 Why Structured Output?

Instead of plain text, results are returned as structured data. This allows:

Easy integration with other applications (dashboards, APIs).

Consistency across multiple queries.

Clear documentation of sources and tools used.

🔧 Core Components

LangChain Agent – Handles reasoning and tool orchestration.

Anthropic Claude – Provides natural language intelligence.

Custom Tools – Extendable functions for research (searching, retrieving, saving).

Pydantic Models – Enforce strict formatting of responses.

🎯 Purpose

The goal is to create a reusable research assistant that can:

Summarize large amounts of data.

Cite reliable sources.

Track which tools were used in the research process.

🌟 Benefits

Automation – Reduces manual effort in finding and summarizing data.

Transparency – Always shows sources and reasoning.

Flexibility – New tools can be added as needed.

Reproducibility – Results follow a consistent schema.
